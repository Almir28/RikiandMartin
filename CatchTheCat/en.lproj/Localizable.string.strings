"This captivating game is inspired by two adorable cats — Riki and Martin, who have not only become the main characters of the game but also its primary testers. The player’s task is to catch kittens, earn points, and progress through levels while avoiding obstacles.\n\nThe goal of the game is to catch as many kittens as possible, earning points and moving to new levels. For each caught kitten, you gain +1 point, and for each missed one, you lose -1 point. But that’s not all: bonus kittens and bombs appear in the game, which can significantly affect your score:\n\n1. Game Rules:\n• A caught kitten gives +1 point.\n• A missed kitten deducts -1 point.\n• Bonus kittens increase your score by 50%.\n• Bombs reduce your score by 50%.\n• The game continues until all points are lost or enough kittens are caught to move to the next level.\n• To advance to the next level, you need to catch 100 kittens for the first level, 150 for the second, and so on.\n\n2. Objective of the Game:\nCatch as many kittens as possible, avoid bombs and bonuses to increase your score and progress through levels. Each new level becomes more challenging, as the speed of the kittens increases, but the reward grows as well.\n\n3. Levels and Difficulty:\n• As you progress to the next level, you’ll need to catch more and more kittens.\n• The difficulty increases with the speed of the kittens and the addition of new elements on the screen.\n\n4. Inspiration and Design:\nThe game was created in honor of the developer’s real cats — Riki and Martin, who inspired this project. They are also the main testers of the game, helping to perfect every detail. The game features a simple and cute design, where kittens appear on the screen, and the player must catch them to earn points and advance to new levels.\n\nGame Development:\nThe game was developed using SpriteKit, allowing for dynamic scenes and animations. The main mechanics are based on the movement of the kittens and interaction with them through screen taps. The simple interface and engaging gameplay make the game suitable for all ages." = "This captivating game is inspired by two adorable cats — Riki and Martin, who have not only become the main characters of the game but also its primary testers.
